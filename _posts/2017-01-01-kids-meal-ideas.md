## Black Bean Quesadillas

Source: [http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250108/black-bean-quesadillas/](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250108/black-bean-quesadillas/)

These satisfying quesadillas take just 15 minutes to make. We like them with black beans, but pinto beans work well too. If you like a little heat, be sure to use pepper Jack cheese in the filling. Serve with: A little sour cream and a mixed green salad.

### Ingredients

1. 1 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed
1. ½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, preferably pepper Jack
1. ½ cup prepared fresh salsa (see Tip), divided
1. 4 8-inch whole-wheat tortillas
1. 2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1. 1 ripe avocado, diced

### Preparation

Active 15 min | Ready in 15 min

1. Combine beans, cheese and ¼ cup salsa in a medium bowl. Place tortillas on a work surface. Spread ½ cup filling on half of each tortilla. Fold tortillas in half, pressing gently to flatten.
1. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 quesadillas and cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and quesadillas. Serve the quesadillas with avocado and the remaining salsa.

Tip: Look for prepared fresh salsa in the supermarket refrigerator section near other dips and spreads.
