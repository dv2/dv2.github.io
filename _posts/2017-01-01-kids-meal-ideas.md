## Black Bean Quesadillas

Source: [http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250108/black-bean-quesadillas/](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250108/black-bean-quesadillas/)

These satisfying quesadillas take just 15 minutes to make. We like them with black beans, but pinto beans work well too. If you like a little heat, be sure to use pepper Jack cheese in the filling. Serve with: A little sour cream and a mixed green salad.

### Ingredients

1. 1 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed
1. ½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, preferably pepper Jack
1. ½ cup prepared fresh salsa (see Tip), divided
1. 4 8-inch whole-wheat tortillas
1. 2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1. 1 ripe avocado, diced

### Preparation

Active 15 min | Ready in 15 min

1. Combine beans, cheese and ¼ cup salsa in a medium bowl. Place tortillas on a work surface. Spread ½ cup filling on half of each tortilla. Fold tortillas in half, pressing gently to flatten.
1. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 quesadillas and cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and quesadillas. Serve the quesadillas with avocado and the remaining salsa.

Tip: Look for prepared fresh salsa in the supermarket refrigerator section near other dips and spreads.

### Ingredients

1. 2 teaspoons olive oil
1. 3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1. 1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1. 1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1. 1 tablespoon brown sugar
1. 1/4 cup salsa
1. 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1. 2 tablespoons butter, divided
1. 8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1. 1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided

### Preparation

Prep: 10 min
Cook: 30 min
Ready in 40 min

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans and corn, then add sugar, salsa, and pepper flakes; mix well. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.
1. Melt 2 teaspoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet, sprinkle evenly with cheese, then top with some of the bean mixture. Place another tortilla on top, cook until golden, then flip and cook on the other side. Melt more butter as needed, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.

Tip: Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.
